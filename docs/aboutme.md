My name is Robbie Koski and I am a recent cybersecurity graduate currently trying to break into the field. I am 22 years old and my personal hobbies include watching movies with friends and family, building keyboards, and wrenching on cars. Over the four years I was working to obtain my bachelors, my passion for cybersecurity has grown immensely and also my understanding of its essential role in the future of organizational and personal security. Everyone nowadays has data they want to protect, and similarly, there will always be someone trying to get ahold of that data. 

Whether is be as simple as pictures stored on your phone, confidential documents on your computer, or ... there are always safeguards and best practices that can be followed to maximize your security.

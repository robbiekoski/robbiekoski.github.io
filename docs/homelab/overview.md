## pfSense

When I started planning for my home network I knew that I wanted to incorporate a dedicated, easily manageable, open source firewall. There were a couple of options that I was choosing from, however, my friend recommended that I check out [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/). So I did, and never looked back. Currently running on a fanless Mini PC from [Qotom](https://www.qotom.net/), my pfSense box serves as my router, firewall, DHCP server, and more that is all easily configurable within a convenient web-based dashboard.

## Unraid

Before I eventually decided to use [Unraid](https://unraid.net/), I was running Proxmox to create and manage my virtual machines and containers. It was very helpful in initially learning the basics of virtualization, however, I felt myself wanting more. Additionally, knowing that I wanted to build myself a NAS in the near future I felt that Unraid would solve all my problems. So I took advantage of their 30-day free trial and instantly fell in love with the simplicity and accessibility that the Unraid UI offers.

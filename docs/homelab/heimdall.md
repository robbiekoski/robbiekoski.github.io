## Purpose

[Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/) serves as my primary dashboard that contains the links to all of my self-hosted services. Very easy to setup, runs as a docker container, you can have your very own application dashboard. For information on how to setup and configure heimdall visit the [official docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall/).

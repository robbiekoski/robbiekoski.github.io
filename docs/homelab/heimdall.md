## Details

[Heimdall](https://heimdall.site/) serves as my primary dashboard that contains the links to all of my self-hosted services. The ability to be quickly deployed as a docker container, options for personalization, and native icon support for many applications makes heimdall the perfect candidate as a homelab dashboard. For information on how to setup and configure heimdall visit the [official docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall/).
